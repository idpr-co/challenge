```

**Controllers**

Go to `api/controllers` folder and you could see our controllers

**Add a new reducer**

Go to `src/reducers/index.js` and import a new reducer, and add the name to the list in the `rootReducer`.

**View application state**

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> to open the Redux Devtools.

### Build production

In production mode, webpack outputs to the `public` directory, allowing the production server to serve static files.

```
npm run deploy
```

### TODO

We did our best in this 3 days , but if you want to improve it
you could add to this project :
